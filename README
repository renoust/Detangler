Installation on Ubuntu

1- install Tulip from pip: 
(apt-get install python-pip if you need pip)
pip install tulip
pip install tulip-python

or install the current Tulip from sources
http://sourceforge.net/projects/auber/files/tulip/

Tulip dependencies
- install cmake
- install cmake-gui (cmake-qt-gui)
- install zlib (zlib1g-dev)
- install glut (freeglut3-dev)
- install glew (libglew-dev)
- install ljpeg (ibjpeg-dev)
- install png (libpng-dev)
- install freetype (libfreetype6-dev)
- install qt (libqt4-dev)
- install qmake (qt4-qmake)
- install blas (libopenblas-dev)
- install lapack (liblapack-dev & liblapacke-dev)
- install fortran (gfortran)
- install python (libpython2.7-dev)


cmake-gui (we are now preparing the compilation of Tulip), a few settings first

- place the source code where you've uncompressed the tar.gz (hereafter "tlproot/")
- place the builds where you want (tlproot/build is advised)
- place CMAKE-INSTALL-PREFIX where you want (advised tlproot/install)

- if the build fails, you may need to place CMAKE-BUILD-TYPE as Debug

go to your BUILD folder (tlproot/build/)
make && make install



Detangler's dependencies:

- install tornado (pip install tornado)
- install scipy (pip install scipy)
- install numpy (pip install numpy)
- install scikit-learn (pip install scikit-learn)


Advised, work from the demo branch (the master branch includes many unstable features)
git clone -b demo --single-branch https://github.com/renoust/Detangler.git

- edit the config file in Detangler/server, to put the location of libtulip(-python ...).so
in out example it's: 
      tulip_lib_path="tlproot/install/lib/"
      tulip_python_path="tlproot/install/lib/python/"

execute the server in
Detangler/server/
tulip-server.sh

Currently the prototype only works well with "Chrome"
to launch the prototype, in chrome:
